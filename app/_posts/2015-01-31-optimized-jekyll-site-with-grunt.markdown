I have started developing static sites with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) in May. For everyone who don't know what it is:

> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.

I liked the idea of modules in site project that eventually will generate static website. Furthermore [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) can generate and host it for you, so you get **free hosting** and **push to deploy** ideology.

That's why it was the perfect choice for [Project Zeppelin](https://github.com/gdg-x/zeppelin) - free site template for conferences (mostly for GDG DevFest, but for sure you can use it as you want). Unfortunately, there are limitations ...
